## How does Blend work?
This blockchain need to be maintained on the network of the organization. And since this is a private blockchain this can be used to store the organization data with out any tampering issues. So nodes in the organization can participate in the network and can maintain the blockchain. This will be a permissioned blockchain and the nodes in the network will be permissioned.

## What is the future of Blend?

Not only single private blockchain can be in this network. any other private blockchain( other organization that uses this blockchain) can intergate with each other with out any issues.

it is a network of private blockchains.
